SETUP 
-----

NOTE: You most likely need to make some modifications of paths.

1. src/sonmezLTM.R should be run from command line with Rscript, e.g., Rscript.exe sonmezLTM.R 60 750 1 ..\data\aesop_00007.wav
You *need* to change the variable
	praatexec to where your praat executable is

Given a wav file it produces:
	an f0 file with floor and ceiling according to the command line call
	a graph of the distribution
	a txt file with the suggested floor and ceiling
	
NOTE: Currently you need to run this from the same directory as where the file sonmezLTM.R is, but you can access files in other directories.

2. src/ltmPitchRange.psc is a script that should be run from within praat after selecting a sound
You *need* to change two variables:
	rscript_exec$ to where your R installation is
	ltm_script$ to where the file sonmezLTMnographics.R is
In sonmezLTMnographics.R, you also *need* to change the variable
	praatexec to where your praat executable is 

It produces:
	a Pitch object with floor and ceiling estimated from an analysis of the distribution
	an Editor with floor and ceiling based on the estimate


bestLTMparams.R
***************

helper function for determining which fit to use.

bestLTM.R
*********

Tries different fitting procedures in order to find one that works (fitting with does not always converge)

getF0.R
*******

F0 analysis through praat, callable from R

getGuess.R
**********

helper for guessing initial values (?)

Get_pitch_to_f0file.psc
***********************

Praat script that does f0 analysis and writes to a file.

guess.R
*******

Tries to find decent initial values for the fitting process.

ltmPitchRange.psc
*****************

Praat script, for running from within praat.

robust.R
********

Functions for robust statistics.

sonmezLTMfon10.R
****************

For reproducing the results in the 2010 paper. Will not work without the speech material.

sonmezLTMnographics.R
*********************

Batch processing for many files (?)

sonmezLTM.R
***********

Rscript executable
