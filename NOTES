NOTE: You most likely need to make some modifications of paths.

1. src/sonmezLTM.R should be run from command line with Rscript, e.g., Rscript.exe sonmezLTM.R 60 750 1 ..\data\aesop_00007.wav
You *need* to change the variable
	praatexec to where your praat executable is

Given a wav file it produces:
	an f0 file with floor and ceiling according to the command line call
	a graph of the distribution
	a txt file with the suggested floor and ceiling
	
NOTE: Currently you need to run this from the same directory as where the file sonmezLTM.R is, but you can access files in other directories.

2. src/ltmPitchRange.psc is a script that should be run from within praat after selecting a sound
You *need* to change two variables:
	rscript_exec$ to where your R installation is
	ltm_script$ to where the file sonmezLTMnographics.R is
In sonmezLTMnographics.R, you also *need* to change the variable
	praatexec to where your praat executable is 

It produces:
	a Pitch object with floor and ceiling estimated from an analysis of the distribution
	an Editor with floor and ceiling based on the estimate
